# Summary

As a junior data analyst in the marketing team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, I am tasked with analyzing data to uncover insights. Cyclistic stands out among bike-share programs with its diverse offerings, including reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, ensuring accessibility for individuals with disabilities and those seeking alternative options. While the majority of riders prefer traditional bikes, around 8% choose the assistive options. Riders predominantly use Cyclistic for leisure purposes, although approximately 30% utilize the bikes for daily commuting. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are considered casual riders, while those with annual memberships are recognized as Cyclistic members.

The director of marketing believes that the company's future success hinges on increasing the number of annual memberships. To achieve this goal, my team aims to understand the distinct usage patterns between casual riders and annual members. Armed with these insights, we will develop a targeted marketing strategy to convert casual riders into loyal annual members. However, the final recommendations must gain approval from Cyclistic executives, necessitating compelling data insights and professional data visualizations to support our findings.

# Purpose

The analysis aims to uncover the differences in how annual members and casual riders utilize Cyclistic bikes. By studying their behavior and usage patterns, we can gain valuable insights into the distinct characteristics of these customer segments. These insights will serve as the foundation for developing a targeted marketing campaign, specifically designed to convert casual riders into loyal annual members. The study will leverage historical bike trip data from the past year to identify relevant trends and patterns.
